# Project history and build map

## Purpose

This file connects the current repository to the decisions and milestones that produced it.
It separates product commits from automated score updates and links formal brief packages
where source artifacts exist.

The history is not a changelog of every line. It is a map for someone asking:

- Why is this architecture static and browser-local?
- Which workstream introduced a feature?
- Where is the original brief or final evidence?
- Which later commit changed the first implementation?
- How should the next brief fit the same process?

## Current product

`sled-mywcbracket` is a no-build, zero-backend World Cup bracket dashboard hosted on GitHub
Pages.

A visitor can build or import a bracket, score it against live results, inspect two bracket
layouts, open match facts, share one bracket through a URL fragment, save received brackets
to a local leaderboard, back up the local pool, switch visual modes, and control decorative
motion.

Personal picks and rivals stay in browser storage. Scheduled GitHub Actions update public
match data and deploy static files.

## Milestone timeline

Automated `chore: auto-sync World Cup match data` commits are omitted. They update generated
data but do not change product architecture.

## How the current process works

New multi-plan work follows a reviewable sequence:

```text
Goal / Context / Source / Expectations
                  |
                  v
            BRIEF.md
                  |
                  v
       ranked plans with exact files
                  |
                  v
     small implementation checkpoints
                  |
                  v
 tests + validators + browser evidence
                  |
                  v
  RESULTS.md + rendered Pages report
```

The Technical Taste Council is an architecture review lens, not an extra runtime system.
Its role is to challenge complexity, protect the no-build contract, keep the next human in
mind, and demand evidence before release.

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/` | Entire deployed GitHub Pages site |
| `docs/js/` | Browser runtime, render model, interactions, storage, social features, match details, trophy, and ball pit |
| `docs/css/` | Dashboard, bracket, font, and theme styles |
| `docs/data/` | Fixed topology, demo picks, and bot-generated public match data |
| `docs/dev-reports/` | Pages-rendered development and learning reports |
| `docs/reports/` | Compatibility redirects for older report URLs |
| `scripts/` | Result fetch, detail generation, and publishing validators |
| `tests/` | Hermetic JavaScript and Python behavior, snapshot, and pipeline coverage |
| `dev-docs/` | Briefs, plans, results, project history, and engineering guidance |
| `.github/workflows/` | Tests, live-data sync, and Pages deployment |

## Source artifact rules

- Preserve original briefs and plans when they exist.
- Mark reconstructed briefs as reconstructions.
- Do not create fake historical plans to fill missing rank numbers.
- Link implementation commits so claims remain auditable.
- Keep measured delivery evidence at its original point in time.
- Record later fixes in the relevant results file.
- Publish interactive HTML under `docs/dev-reports/` so GitHub Pages renders it.
- Keep compatibility redirects when an older tracked document links the previous path.

## Current brief packages

| Brief | Source | Plans | Result |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| [Zero-backend social loop](zero-backend-social-loop/README.md) | Original `SPEC.md` | 2 preserved, 1 historical link | Complete |
| [Live tournament readiness](live-tournament-readiness/README.md) | Reconstructed from six committed plans | 6 | Complete |
| [Production match experience](production-match-experience/README.md) | Reconstructed from report and delivery | 0 standalone, 6 report phases | Complete |
| [Animation performance revision](animation-performance-revision/README.md) | Original brief | 6 | Complete |

## What remains outside a formal brief

Small or one-commit milestones stay in this history instead of receiving artificial brief
packages. These include the font pass, individual themes, settled scoring, private pool
backup, and the first soccer-ball hero delivery.

If one of those areas grows into new multi-plan work, create a new brief package and link it
back to the relevant milestone here.
