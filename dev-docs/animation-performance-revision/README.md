# Animation performance revision

Status: complete

Project phase: client-side animation and WebGL performance, July 11, 2026.

This folder keeps the original brief, its six execution plans, the measured starting point,
and the final result together.

## Read in order

1. [Brief](BRIEF.md)
2. [Measured baseline](BASELINE.md)
3. [Execution plans](plans/)
4. [Final results](RESULTS.md)
5. [Reusable audit prompt](BRIEF.md#reusable-client-side-performance-review-prompt)
6. [Interactive report](https://eriic-builds.github.io/sled-mywcbracket/dev-reports/animation-performance-revision/)

The interactive report source lives at
[`docs/dev-reports/animation-performance-revision/index.html`](../../docs/dev-reports/animation-performance-revision/index.html).
Keeping it under `docs/` lets the existing GitHub Pages workflow render the dashboard.
The report's **Reuse prompt** tab contains the same project-agnostic client-side audit
prompt in a copy-ready format.

## Place in the project

This revision followed the
[production match experience](../production-match-experience/README.md), private pool
backup, and the interactive soccer-ball hero. It kept the approved motion while reducing
layout, paint, RAF, and WebGL work.

See the [project history](../PROJECT-HISTORY.md) for the full sequence.
